# Project 1: Choose your own adventure!!

## Description:

The purpose of this program is to help you get used to python syntax, if/else statements, and functions.

The project is as such: Create a program in Python that leads a user through a choose-your-own adventure-type story! 
it could be inspired by a movie or book you like, an original story, or even something based on a painting- the world is your oyster!

My own example will be available as well - feel free to run it!

## Requirements:

Your story should have at least:
- three user-defined functions
- the user input 4 times
- a nested if/else statement (example in project_1_example.py)
