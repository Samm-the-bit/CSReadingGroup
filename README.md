# CSReadingGroup
Welcome to the Computer science in Mathematics reading group! 2023!!
Language: Python

# 1. Course expectations:

At the end of this course, you should have a good idea of how to take a problem and solve it using the tools we have discussed, or find a tool and be able to pick it up quickly. 
This isn't just about knowing how to write lies of python code either. You will be able to break up a problem into useable chunks, think functionally for function oriented programming, and use this logic to construct calculators and hopefully even teach a computer something.

Everyone is expected to read the sources for each week, participate in the class discussions and projects, and hand type each assignment.
Before the first class everyone should have python and an IDE of their choice installed. (See useful links page for reccomendations)
This course is fast paced. Be prepared for a bit of a challenge. You do not have to complete every single assignment. ***Do not let this get in the way of your classes***.

## PRE-RECS:
None! This course is intended for those who either have never touched a line of code to someone who maybe had a class years ago. All you need is a eager heart and a computer.

## Coding is a tool
How does one learn to use a tool? by using it, ofcourse. If you want to learn to use a hammer, you watch a video, maybe have a friend show you how, but ultimately you have to pick it up and give it a good swing. The first couple might miss, the hammer will feel awkward and bulky, and you might even hit your thumb once (or seven times((((dont ask))))), but that is a part of the process. Then months from the first time you picked up a hammer, you'll find that hitting the nail is like nothing. 
Coding is a weird cuthuluesk hammer but listen, it cannot hurt you, only you can hurt it. 
Here's the thing though- it is up to you to get what you want out of this course. If you hand code all of the assignments, I can assure you that you will be a better programmer than many many engineers I have met. ChatGPT is a looming option, but, for the same reasons you dont learn to swing a hammer by having a robot do it for you, I do not reccomend using it except in the mopst dire of situations. 
Instead, I reccomend stack overflow, geeks for geeks, or w3schools. they should have all of your answers. Also there is a discord for all of your debugging needs. One of the best ways to learn something is by debugging someone elses code.
